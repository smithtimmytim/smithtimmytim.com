Kelly says I have a bit of a keyboard problem. You see, I have four keyboards in this office, counting the one I’m currently typing on.

But the point of this post isn’t to talk about how I’m going to get this addiction under control, it’s more about showing you the new toy. I bought the [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-mechanical-keyboard), which is my first tenkeyless keyboard. I’ve been clinging to that number pad for some reason, but no longer!

I’ve been using the keyboard for about a day and I’m pretty pleased so far. I bought the version with brown switches, which is also a first for me since blue switches are what I usually pick. The brown switches are nice, but the blue ones are my favorite. If you work close to people, brown switches are much softer and quieter, but I work at home [all by myself](https://music.apple.com/us/album/all-by-myself/1268085628?i=1268087248), so noise isn’t really an issue for me.

They moved the button to control the RGB backlights, which is a welcome change. I own the Keychron K1 and constantly hit that button accidentally.

The only issue I have with this keyboard (after a day of use, so take it with a grain of salt) is the missing `⌥ option` key on the right side. While their custom screenshot button is pretty cool, I’d rather have the `⌥ option` key, and move the `fn` key to the top.

[You can buy your own](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-mechanical-keyboard) starting at $69 USD.

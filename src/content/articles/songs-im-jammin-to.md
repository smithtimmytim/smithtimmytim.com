summary: 'A list of ten songs I’m enjoying'
---
Music is what powers my everyday. If it weren’t for music and coffee, I wouldn’t even be able to type this right now, much less do anything productive. Here’s a list of songs I have _on repeat_.

Note: There may be a mix of old and new songs. All links are for Apple Music because that’s what I use.

1. [**Come Thru by Summer Walker & Usher**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-thru/1481606156?i=1481606162)  
So cool to have Usher on a song that samples one of [his previous songs](https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-make-me-wanna/278845426?i=278845473). Summer has some great songs on [this album](https://music.apple.com/us/album/over-it/1481606156) and I thought she was honest and raw with her lyrics throughout.
2. [**Indica Badu (feat. Wiz Khalifa) by Logic**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/indica-badu-feat-wiz-khalifa/1355196892?i=1355197424)  
This song is perfect to get stoned to. It’s got a beat you can help but nod your head to, and some amazing weed references in the verses. In fact, [here’s my weed playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/lets-get-baked/pl.u-W2P7FvpBeg1).
3. [**Loyal (feat. Drake) by PARTYNEXTDOOR**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/loyal-feat-drake/1487539206?i=1487539223)  
This is one of those songs I didn’t think much of on first listen, but then really grew on me. [“Come and See Me”](https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-and-see-me-feat-drake/1136197106?i=1136197236) is another great song by these two.
4. [**Te Quiero by Maluma**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/te-quiero/1461912465?i=1461912708)  
Talk about a song title being misleading! I’ve recently become a fan of Maluma, and I love the salsa feel of this song.
5. [**Money by Moonchild**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/money/1473502345?i=1473502772)
This song was one of the ones performed by Moonchild for [their NPR Tiny Desk Concert](https://youtu.be/B_ymY0xG0LI). It’s hard for me to resist music with saxophone.
6. [**Gidget (feat. Anderson .Paak & T.Nava) by Free Nationals**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/gidget-feat-anderson-paak-t-nava/1485339428?i=1485339444)
I can’t handle all the funk of this song. Anderson .Paak is wonderful as usual. If you enjoy this song, take a listen to [the rest of the album](https://music.apple.com/us/album/free-nationals/1485339428).
7. [**Good Thing by Zedd & Kehlani**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-thing/1481152671?i=1481152674)
The beat is great and I love the empowering lyrics.
8. [**Yummy by Justin Bieber**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/yummy/1492502421?i=1492502431)
Dare you to try not having the hook of this song stuck in your head. Justin Bieber has gotten so much hate over the years, but he’s so talented. Great song.
9. [**Cinderella (feat. Ty Dolla $ign) by Mac Miller**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cinderella-feat-ty-dolla-%24ign/1137965822?i=1137966332)
RIP Mac. From what I’ve read, this song is in large part about Ariana Grande. I’m a sucker for a good sex and love song.
10. [**My Cherie Amour (feat. Adam Levine) by Joe Pesci**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-cherie-amour-feat-adam-levine/1484015665?i=1484016044)
Yup. A song by Joe Pesci and Adam Levine. I didn’t even know that Joe Pesci sings. It’s really good though.
